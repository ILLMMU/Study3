Twenty four healthy university students age ranging between `r description$min[2]`-`r description$max[2]`( mean age ± SD:`r MOTE::apa(description$mean[2],2,T)`±`r MOTE::apa(description$sd[2],2,T)`)- 16 females, (Mean age ± SD = `r MOTE::apa(description_gender$Female$mean[2],2,T)`±`r MOTE::apa(description_gender$Female$sd[2],2,T)` ) and 8 males (Mean age ± SD = `r MOTE::apa(description_gender$Male$mean[2],2,T)`±`r MOTE::apa(description_gender$Male$sd[2],2,T)` ) were studies in the Intelligent Lighting Lab at Monash University Malaysia. The study obtained ethics clearance from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (Project ID: 14786) and participants provided written informed consent prior to study. All participants reported to be free from medial and psychological conditions and had no color blindness  (tested by Ishihara Blindness Test [@clark1924ishihara]). Majority of them were poor sleeper (`r desc_tibble[12,2]`) and had intermediate chronotype (`r desc_tibble[15,2]`).

## Light Exposure Conditions
The experimental site was at Intelligent Light Lab, Monash University Malaysia (length x width x height; xx m by xx m by xx m). The lab was furnished with one ractangular working desk with three chairs. The walls of the lab was covered with grey cartains and all glass windows were covered by blackout blinds. The room temperature was set to 25$^0$ C. The three light conditions were generated using 12 Phillips tuneable LED ceiling mounted luminaries. We have measured the light sources at the horizontal plane at desk level (80 cm) and the vertical plane at eye level of the participants seated at the desk (122 cm). Figure XX  depicts the spectral composition of the three light conditions. Table XX presents alpha-opic melanopic equivalent daylight illuminances (Melanopic EDI) and melanopic daylight efficacy ratio (MDER) values both at desk and eyelevel for the three light conditions: (a) high MDER light settings (HM):`r light_indices[1,10]` MDER, `r light_indices[1,6]` MEDI, `r light_indices[1,11]` K; (b) neutral MDER light settings (NM):`r light_indices[2,10]` MDER, `r light_indices[2,6]` MEDI, `r light_indices[2,11]` K;  and (c) low MDER light settings (LM): `r light_indices[3,10]` MDER, `r light_indices[3,6]` MEDI, `r light_indices[3,11]` K. For all light conditions At the beginning of each sessions the light exposure level was maintained at approximately 250 photopic lx at the horizontal plane (79.23 μW/cm$^2$) and approximately 139 lx (42.79 μW/cm$^2$) at the vertical plane for thirty minutes. After this adaptation period, the photopic lx of  three light settings were kept ~250 lx at desk level (Mean=`r MOTE::apa(light_indices_summary$mean_photopic[1],2,T)`; SD=±`r MOTE::apa(light_indices_summary$sd_photopic[2],2,T)`). In vertical plane at eye level the mean photopic lx was `r MOTE::apa(light_indices_summary$mean_photopic[1],2,T)` (SD=±`r MOTE::apa(light_indices_summary$sd_photopic[2],2,T)`). The α-opic values and MDER values are obtained using Loux software (Spitschan et al., 2022) and CIE S 026:2018 toolbox (Schlangen, 2020) following the CIE S 026 guidelines (CIE, 2018b). 


## Study Protocol
Participants were asked not to ingest any caffeine and drink alcohol on the experiment day. Each session started with a practice block to familiarize the participants with the cognitive tests. Each participant spent approximately two hours in our lab in a time cue free environment (all doors and windows covered with blinds, no watches, internet, mobile, TV, newspaper and radio). Participants were randomly assigned to one the light conditions and were allowed thirty minutes to attune to the light condition. During this thirty minutes they answered a series of a questionnaire regarding their demographic information sleep quality, chronotype and completed Ishihara Blindness Test [@clark1924ishihara]. Throughout the two hour protocol participants remained seated at their desks. Exercising and napping were not allowed. Participants took part in a series of cognitive tests in the following order: aPVT, N-back test, digit span, and Tower of London test . Subjective measures of sleepiness  were recorded both at the beginning and the end of the protocol.

## Data analysis

We used R [@R-base] for all our analyses using packages including psych [@R-psych], tabledown, and WRS2 [@R-WRS2]. Classical ANOVA methods assumes normality and homoscedascity and any violation to these assumptions raise serious practical concerns. Hence we used 10% trimmed mean based robust oneway or factorial anova which were less prone to these these assumption violations and outliers [@R-WRS2]. "t1way"  and "bwtrim" functions from the package "WRS2"[@R-WRS2] were used to conduct the robust oneway and factorial ANOVA respectively. We reported$\xi$ as the explanatory measure of the effect size where 0.10, 0.30, 0.50 correspond to small, medium and large effect size. The confidence interval of the effect size was estimated using 1000 bootstrap samples [@wilcox2011measuring]. In case of a significant F statistics we conducted robust pairwise post-hoc tests to compare  the three light conditions using "lincon" function with Bonferroni correction from WRS2.   

# Results

## Alerting effects

We observed a significant differences in subjective sleepiness across the three light settings [F(2,11.7)=4.85, p=0.03, $\xi$ = 0.69 (CI: 0.42-1.04)]. Post-hoc tests revealed that there was a trend of reporting decreased subjective sleepiness (beginning of the protocol vs end of the protocol) in High condition compared to Low ($\hat{\psi}$ =--1.71; p=0.09) and Neutral ($\hat{\psi}$ = --1.86; p=0.07) light conditions. No significant difference between Low and neutral light condition was observed (p=1.0).

In aPVT, we did not observe any significant effect of light conditions on general reaction time [F(2,10.1)=1.29, p=0.32, $\xi$ = 0.54 (CI: 0.21-1.03)], attention lapses [F(2,10.99)=0.49, p=0.63, $\xi$ = 0.34 (CI: 0.07-0.73)], and 10% fastest reaction time [F(2,12.21)=0.09, p=0.91, $\xi$ = 0.29 (CI: 0.06-0.66) ]

## Working Memory and Executive Functioning

We observed a significant differences in forward digit span task across the three light settings [F(2,12.14)=4.99, p=0.03, $\xi$ = 0.59 (CI: 0.34-0.82)]. Post-hoc tests revealed that participants performaed significantly better in Neutral condition compared to Low light condition ($\hat{\psi}$=-1.57, p<0.04). No other pair-wise comparison in Forward digit span was significant. We did not observe any significant differences in backward [F(2,12.11)=0.33, p=0.72, $\xi$ = 0.37 (CI: 0.07-0.88)] and sequential digit span task performance [F(2,12.05)=0.54, p=0.60, $\xi$ = 0.41 (CI: 0.1-0.74)].

In the ToL task we observed a significant effect of light condition on execution time [F(2,11.47)=4.38, p=0.04, $\xi$ = 0.59 (CI: 0.31-0.85)]. Participants under Low light condition had signifiacntly lower efficiency than participants under neutral light condition ($\hat{\psi}$=-10.89, p<0.04). We did not observe any significant influence of light on efficiency [F(2,12.56)=0.11, p=0.90, $\xi$ = 0.31 (CI: 0.06-0.68)] and planning time [F(2,10.57)=1.20, p=0.34, $\xi$ = 0.48 (CI: 0.16-1.04)] in the ToL task.

In N-back task we observed a significant main effect of task difficulty where participants had significantly faster reaction time [F(1,11.76)=45.71, p<0.001, $\xi$ = 0.88 (CI: 0.78-0.98)]  and higher accuracy [F(1,6.72)=44.43, p<0.001, $\xi$ = 0.94 (CI: 0.75-0.99)] in the easy blocks (one back) compared to difficult blocks (two-blocks). However, we did not observe any significant effect of light condition on reaction time [F(2,9.26)=2.90, p=0.10, $\xi$ = 0.41 (CI: 0-0.79)], accuracy [F(2,6.11)=1.24, p=0.35, $\xi$ = 0.14 (CI: 0-0.68)],hit ratio [F(2,7.05)=2.82, p=0.13, $\xi$ = 0.13 (CI: 0-0.60)], false alarm [F(2,5.7)=1.28, p=0.35, $\xi$ = 0.24 (CI: 0-0.81)], sensitivity [F(2,2.91)=1.22, p=0.41, $\xi$ = 0.08 (CI: 0-0.61)], bias [F(2,2.67)=3.68, p=0.17, $\xi$ = 0.14 (CI: 0-0.68)].

Further, we observed no significant interaction effect of light condition and task complexity on N back reaction time [F(2,9.25)=1.46, p=0.28, $\xi$ = 0.41 (CI: CI: 0-0.79)] and accuracy [F(2,6.11)=0.32, p=0.74, $\xi$ = 0.14 (CI: 0-0.68)], hit ratio [F(2,7.05)=2.24, p=0.18, $\xi$ = 0.03 (CI: 0-0.56)], false alarm [F(2,5.7)=1.28, p=0.59, $\xi$ = 0.24 (CI: 0-0.78)],sensitivity [F(2,2.91)=0.03, p=0.97, $\xi$ = 0.08 (CI: 0-0.55)], bias [F(2,2.67)=1.41, p=0.38, $\xi$ = 0.71 (CI: 0.18-0.91)].
